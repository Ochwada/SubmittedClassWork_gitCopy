## 📚 *"Digital Time Capsule"*

### 🏷️ Background

Imagine it's the year 2025. You want to leave a note and a digital memory for your future self — kind of like a **"Time Capsule"**. But instead of burying a box in the ground, you're saving a message and an image file on your hard drive.

Your job is to:

* Write a heartfelt message to a text file.
* Read it back to display it on the console.
* Copy the message and a memorable image to a secure backup location using **Java streams**.

This simulates what many backend applications do: generating content, persisting it, and copying or backing it up for durability.

### 🎯 Objectives

* Learn to use **character streams** to read and write text files.
* Understand how **byte streams** handle binary data like images.
* Practice **buffered I/O** for performance.
* Write **clear Javadoc and inline comments**.
* Structure a small program using clean Java conventions.
