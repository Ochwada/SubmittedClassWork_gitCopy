# Mini Survey Validator with Java Reflections & Annotations

## ðŸ“– Background

Imagine you're building a **survey collection system** for a research agency.

Participants fill out a form with:

* Name
* Age
* Email
* Feedback

As developers, your job is to ensure **data validation** before the system stores any response.

Instead of hardcoding validation for every field, youâ€™ll use **Annotations + Reflection** to define rules and validate objects dynamically â€” the way frameworks like Spring or Hibernate do under the hood.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will:

* Understand how to **write and use custom annotations**
* Learn how to use **Reflection** to process annotations at runtime
* Build a **reusable, flexible validation engine**
* Improve clean coding practices by separating metadata (rules) from logic

---

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

* Java 8+ (for Reflection, Streams, Lambdas)
* JUnit 5 (for writing test cases)
* Maven (for project structure)
